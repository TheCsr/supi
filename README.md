This is an IoT based Project which uses the DHT11 sensor (to measure humidity and temperature) , a mq7 sensor ( to detect the carbon mono oxide gases )  and A buzzer . If the gas sensor detects CO the buzzer starts to ring . The  temperature and the humidity sensor gives the reading which is saved in the database which is finally displayed on the website in realtime.
